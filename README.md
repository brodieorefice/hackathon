## Hackathon
Hackathon is a school project that I started for a short coding assignment. Right now, it is an un-optimized dumpster fire but I am looking to create a more growth friendly version of it. 
Mission 1 is the only fully coded out mission, and it was created to pass the requirements, but it could serve as a good starting point for new features.

## End Goal
The end goal of the Hackathon project is to create a somewhat lightweight simulation of hacking tools for anyone who can't/don't want to set up a virutal machine. Maybe eventually evolve it 
into a python library with an easy to use file system. Storing files in something such as a hashmap or other data structure may prove benifical instead of relying on ``os`` commands.
